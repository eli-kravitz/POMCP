# POMCP

This repo contains a Paritally Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) class, as well as an associated Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planner (POMCP) class to perform decision making under uncertainty. The POMCP solver is intended to be robust to any POMDP definition. Note that more optimization is required to make this implementation feasible for real-time applications with all but the simplest POMDPs.
